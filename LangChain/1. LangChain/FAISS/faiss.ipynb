The team was involved in competitions, such as running the Video Game Masters Tournament for Guinness World Records[26][27] and sponsoring the North American Video Game Challenge tournament.[28] A multicity tour in 1983, the \"Electronic Circus\", was used to feature these players in live challenges before audiences, and draw more people to video games.[22] These video game players and tournaments were featured in well-circulated newspapers and popular magazines including Life and Time and became minor celebrities at the time, such as Billy Mitchell.[29][30] Besides establishing the competitive nature of games, these types of promotional events all formed the nature of the marketing and promotion that formed the basis of modern esports.[22]'),\n",
